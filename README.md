# ChatgptWordle
pretty self explanatory, had chatgpt write wordle.
Yes, I know that If you get a letter right and there is a duplicate letter (ex: Hello) and the first L is correct, the second L is still yellow, but i refuse to code this anymore due to the fact that im tired of it. enjoy.

ALSO! This is much more difficult than regular wordle, there are no resets, and there are many, _many_ more awnsers thate are really stupid like beisa and fluyt, so good luck. i challenge you to get better than a 50 streak without code modifications.

you can also download this as an html and play it. Click the arrow next to "code" on the top left, at the bottom click download zip, extract, run index.html. If i find this on any website without permission, i will dmca. (note that i cant actually do that, as its ai generated and law states that it is illegal to claim ai creations. Also technically a product of openai, but im not using it for monitization so :\ not a real threat, but just ask.)
